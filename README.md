Unzip and install the FPS-Fix directory in your Community folder. DO NOT REPLACE THE BASE GAME FILES.

Your community directory by default is located in C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community

If you changed this location during installation, you will not see any files in ..\Packages and will have to find your Community folder.

Open your game and enable Developer Mode (In Settings > Developer). This will enable the developer menu.

From the developer menu at the top of the screen, go to Tools > Virtual File System.

Expand the Watched Bases tab. This is your Community folder, where the mod must be installed to.

-------------

Usage:

By default, the default refresh settings are as listed.

You can change this per airplane in the Flight Settings > FPS > Display Refresh options menu before you begin your flight. (Currently this read-only, you can modify it with a text editor but saving settings in game is not supported yet)

Note that Very Low is a demonstration mode to simply make it obvious that the mod is actually doing something. It's not recommendeed and the recommended setting for most users is HIGH.

ULTRA will completely disable the refresh rate modification and revert to vanilla behaviour.
